# Final Test
This is a test created by our coach [Lambelin Rafael](https://github.com/rafaello104)


## Objectives

The purpose of this test is to evaluate our individual skills and growth.


## Description

We had to make a grocery list where we can add  items, remove them, animate and more. Personally, I would categorize this test as a 'when and who' type.
When you manipulate the events you have to ask yourself the following questions:
 + when the event is triggered?
 + who triggers the event?
 + who suffers the consequences?

## Instructions

List of full instructions available [here](https://github.com/becodeorg/GNT-Yu-1.10/blob/master/2.The-Hills/1.Javascript-Intro/1.DOM-Manipulation/6.Final-Test.md);

## The most difficult tasks

Tasks 12 and 13, where I had to save the grocery list in the local storage and to make the list exactly the same when the page is refreshed. I did not have to deal with the web storage before, but eventually I learned enough to finish this exercise. I found a very helpful example [here](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-use-local-storage-with-javascript/?fbclid=IwAR31nNlkdgy5MnHk9Orh5JNXJ8UrvcGWAPRCzpRSDK29W_1iEC6N7_vVDxs)


Everything after that  became more difficult. I had to restructure the code several times, because some of the variables had to be available for more functions, and some functions had to be reused. Following the number of rows,  also restructured my code, lost alot of time here and decided to get the length of rows every time I needed to make changes to the table's length.

Task 14, where i had to make every row slightly darker than the previous one, combined with task 15 where the background colors of the rows below should shift up in brightness (as if no difference is visible), when a row is deleted.


Task 21 was confusing to me. I wasn't clear if we had to rearrange the items in the table, or replace it. I choosed to replace it.

## The tasks I loved the most
I loved task 12 and 13. Even though it was difficult for me, I like learning new things, and it increased my self esteem.

I enjoyed task 14. At first I tried to add a filter and change the brightness of every row, but it didn't looked good. I never used HSL Colors, never sow the point, but it looked like a good idea. I was very pleased of the results, and got a little exited thinking about what else can I do with HSL colors.

I liked task 21 because I got to play a little with arrays.

## Results

Results available [here](https://alexandramadalina.github.io/JS-Final-Test--Completed/)
Overall, I think this test has a good structure. Tasks are interconnected and have a domino effect. I enjoyed this test, it was a good challenge and kept my interest until the end. I like the way it pushes your hand to write your code in a certain way,  so that you can reuse picece of code for other scopes.
